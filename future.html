							<h2>My oldest brother always tells me that I need to plan my future, so I would have a path to go through. 
							I think he is right! The path we create is not absolute must, it is just a recommendation we made ourselves. 
							In my opinion, you should have a plan for 5-10 years. Right now is September 2020; it is my last year at university. 
							<ul><li>Graduate from university.</li><li> Find a good job and stabilize my position there.</li><li>Find a life partner/have a life partner. 
							</li><li>Get married/ be married; Combine family-career.</li><li>Stable my personal life and career.</li></ul> Indeed, only God knows what and how everything will happen, but we can do our best in order to achieve our plans. 
							Thatâ€™s why I have few years for unexpected circumstances.</h2>
