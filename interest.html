							<h2>I like to think that I am different than most of the people. 
							I don’t like cold weather, parties, alcohol, unsafe connections or drugs. 
							I am not a big fun of photography, however I love taking pictures of really beautiful places, for example first picture. 
							It might be not the best picture, but I like it. I also like quietness and peace especially when I study or read (look at the second picture, the study room is empty). 
							I can be noisy and loud only with friends. I like good food, warm weather, protected connections (whatever that means to you), and I like <a href="travel.html">travelings</a>. 
							We talk about it a lot, but that is for personal meeting!</h2>
