							<h2>I like traveling, because you can learn something new about foreign people and their culture. 
							Also, if you stay long enough in a new place you can find out that “developed” country is not a “heaven on Earth”. 
							In 1997, I and my family went to live in Israel for 4 years (I don’t have jpg pictures from there). Somewhere in between 2001-2016 I have been several times in Uzbekistan. 
							I finished first year at LCC when I went to Greece for summer work, you can see first picture. After my second year at LCC I went to the USA to work, specifically to state of Wisconsin through Illinoi, you can see second picture. 
							After third year at LCC I went to the USA again, specifically to state of Colorado, you can see third picture. If you want to go back short story of my life than go to <a href="index.html">”My Life”</a> section. 
							If you want to see my interest than go to <a href="interest.html">”Interests”</a>section. And Finally, if you want to know how I see my life in 5-10 years go to <a href="future.html">”Future Life”</a>section. </h2>
