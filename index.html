							<h2>My name is Aldiyar Ayazbayev and I am 27 years old. I am single with no kids (yet).
							I come from Kazakhstan and I am proud about it! I have two older brothers and five cousins, plus I have four nieces and two nephews.
							After graduation from high school I started to work in different places in order to help my family. In 2016 the financial situation of my family became stable, so I decided to get an education and I entered LCC.
							Now is end of September 2020, and this is my last year at my university. If you want to know about traveling I have had in my life go to <a href="travel.html">"Travelings"</a>section. 
							If you want to know about what I am interested in go to <a href="interest.html">"Interests"</a>section. And finally, if you want to know how I see my life in 5-10 years go to <a href="future.html">"Future Life"</a>section.</h2>
